My central interest lies in applying machine learning to solve logical problems and using logic to improve machine learning systems. I believe that by making AI more logical, we can build  more generalizable, explainable and trustworthy systems.

My background is in Logic and Computation.

From 2022 to 2024, I worked As a researcher and developer at [Fermioniq](https://www.fermioniq.com/), where I worked on quantum circuit emulation with tensor networks. I am currently pursuing a PhD under supervision of [Balder ten Cate](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/b.d.tencate/).

I enjoy teaching and presenting, and I'm always looking for ways to apply my technical background to socially meaningful problems. At the moment, I'm contributing to [GOAL3](https://www.goal3.org/nl), using AI and logic to predict critical illness events in low-resource intensive care units. The goal is to build an explainable prediction tool that can help save lives.
