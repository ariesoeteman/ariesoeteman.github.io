My central interest lies in applying machine learning to solve logical problems and using logic to improve machine learning systems. I believe that by making AI more logical, we can build generalizable, explainable and trustworthy systems.

My background is in Logic and Computation.
<!-- , with recent research projects spanning the expressiveness of machine learning models, logical programming, quantum computing and computational social choice.  -->
From 2022 to 2024, I worked as a researcher and developer at [Fermioniq](https://www.fermioniq.com/), where I worked on quantum circuit emulation with tensor networks. I am currently pursuing a PhD under supervision of [Balder ten Cate](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/b.d.tencate/).

I enjoy teaching and presenting, and I'm always looking for ways to apply my technical background to socially meaningful problems. At the moment, I'm contributing to [GOAL3](https://www.goal3.org/nl), using AI and logic to predict critical illness events in low-resource intensive care units. The goal is to build an explainable prediction tool that can help save lives.

If you are interested in any of these topics and would like to discuss ideas, feel free to connect on Linkedin or send an email to a.w.[my surname]@uva.nl. I am always open to talk. Also, if you're in Amsterdam let me know if you'd like to visit the [Automated Reasoning Amsterdam seminar](https://events.illc.uva.nl/ARA/) at Science Park, where we discuss recent work in logic and AI.
