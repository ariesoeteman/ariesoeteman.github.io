As a researcher and developer at [Fermioniq](https://www.fermioniq.com/), I am exploring quantum algorithms nd tensor network optimisation. My main focus is currently on improving the capacities of classical quantum circuit emulators using tensor network techniques.

My background is in Logic and Computation, with recent research project spanning topics such as Automata Theory, Quantum Computing, Computational Social Choice, Cognitive Modelling, Logical Programming, Philosophy of AI and Proof Theory. My central interest is in combining Machine Learning and Logic to create noise-resistant and explainable AI systems.

I love teaching and presenting, and enjoy coding my way around problems. Finally, I'm always looking for ways to apply my technical background to social issues. See [this](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-20614-6_19) project on fairer resource allocation via local elections, and [this](https://vu.nl/nl/over-de-vu/meer-over/amsterdam-oase-studiecafe) social meeting place for students in Amsterdam. Please let me know if you if you're setting up a social project and think I could help.

If you are interested in any of these topics and would like to discuss ideas, please feel free to send me a message on Linkedin. I am always open to talk.
